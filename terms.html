                <p>You acknowledge that the Service is currently in a "beta" phase.

                <p>We may offer an optional, paid "Pro" subscription in the future.

                <p>Any such subscription will be subject to a fee, such as a recurring charge (e.g., approximately $1.99/month), though all pricing and features are subject to change at our discretion. During the current beta phase, these "Pro" features may be unavailable, provided for free testing, or otherwise modified.</p>
                <p>All payments for subscriptions will be handled by a secure third-party payment processor. We do not store your full credit card information on our servers. More details on billing, refunds, and cancellations will be provided at the time of the feature's launch.</p>
